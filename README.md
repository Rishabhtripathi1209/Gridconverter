PDF to Image Grid Converter (4x2 Up-Down Layout)
Overview
This Python script converts PDF slides into a 4x2 grid where the images are arranged vertically in columns. The slides are stacked in columns (up-down format), with the first column containing images from 1 to 4, and the second column containing images from 5 to 8. The script skips the first slide of the PDF and arranges the slides into a grid of images, saving the result as a PDF file.
